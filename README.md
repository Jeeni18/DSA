# Computer Programming & Algorithmic Thinking

This repository contains a set of notebooks demonstrating core programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms implemented from scratch. The goal is to show mastery of algorithmic reasoning, complexity analysis, and clean coding practices.

## Notebooks Included

1. **01_Arrays_and_Time_Complexity.ipynb**  
   Manual implementation of arrays and lists, linear and binary search, insertion, and complexity analysis.

2. **02_Stack_and_Queue.ipynb**  
   Implementation of Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) using Python classes, with complexity discussion.

3. **03_Linked_List.ipynb**  
   Singly Linked List implementation to demonstrate memory references, node manipulation, and traversal.

4. **04_Sorting_and_Complexity.ipynb**  
   Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort implemented from scratch with time and space complexity analysis and trade-offs.

5. **05_Binary_Search_Tree.ipynb**  
   Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation including insert, search, and inorder traversal. Demonstrates recursion, hierarchy, and performance considerations.


## Key Features

- Manual implementation of core data structures and algorithms.
- Complexity reasoning (time & space) for each algorithm.
- Modular, clean code demonstrating separation of concerns.
- Reflection on algorithmic trade-offs and design decisions.

## Purpose

This repo demonstrates practical understanding of programming, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills. It bridges theory and implementation, highlighting how fundamental concepts are applied in real-world software and machine learning systems.
